      <p>
        Hello there, glad you stopped by.
        We appreciate the fact that you have a
        calculator on your phone -- probably a
        better one -- but you decided to spend
        some data to check out our site.
        Or Maybe your phone just run out of battery?
        Either way we are glad that you came and hopefully
        your phone runs out of battery more often.
      </p>
      <p>
        So to the basics. You can perfom basic mathematical
        calculations (Additions, Divisions, Multiplication,
        Modulus, and Subtraction). What about the other
        Arithmetic operations? You may have to buy an actual
        calculator for that.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit and use my calculator</p>
